This is a contract between an artist a and a client. 

Every line in the contract has a number. This is how coders work. We are coding a relationship in support of the artists. 

Every document can be edited, by all parties involved, depending on which rights they receive. 
Every edit must be 'comitted', which is something similar to saving with some additional options how to save the edit. 

DEpending on the licence we give this 'repository', others can use and modify it. 

Furthermore, they can make new 'branches' based on this one, by forking it. Forking is a process that allows multiple 
coders to create developments of an orginal piece of code and then bring it together again eventually.

There is plenty of documentation about this process, as all code nowadays is written using this process. 

What do you think?
